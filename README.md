## Bootstrap 4 Grid Review (part 1)

Let’s review some key concepts:

- When in doubt, check Bootstrap’s [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/).
- There are a few required links to use Bootstrap (the CSS file and two \<meta> tags)
- Bootstrap 4 has a grid system implemented using flexbox
- The grid system is made of containers, rows, and columns that work together to make a web page’s layout.
- Containers are needed to implement the grid.
- Containers hold rows which hold columns.
- Bootstrap’s grid follows a 12 column system.
- Bootstrap uses responsive design and is built around breakpoints related to device screen sizes.
- To manually set the width of a column we have to follow Bootstrap’s naming convention (col-md-6).
- We can add multiple classes to a column to determine how wide a column should be on specific breakpoints (col-12 col-sm-10).
